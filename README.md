### New Product Opportunity
Currently, HealthMax is present in only 2 of the 5 shampoo subcategories, limiting its total addressable market. Among these, the Organic segment is the fastest-growing, projected to expand 20% year-over-year by end of 2024, based on March 2023 MAT values.

<br>
To capitalize on this growth, HealthMax is preparing to launch two Organic SKUs: Herbshine and HerbEssentials. While Herbshine is forecasted to generate higher gross profit, HerbEssentials is expected to drive greater net sales, offering strategic flexibility depending on margin vs. volume prioritization.

<br>
Consumer insights also indicate a demand for 50ml travel-size shampoo, a segment currently underserved by HealthMax (minimum size: 100ml).
<br>
A proposed 50ml launch is projected to add $265,960 in net sales, tapping into a new customer segment and offering high-margin growth potential. <br>
